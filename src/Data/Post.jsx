        title: "Switching Between Seasons",
        description: "Summer season is here; it’s going to get hotter, with morning sunshine that could boil yam, a black dog suffered on a summer’s day. Ladies get to bathe before noon, street footballers get to do their worst with stenches of heavy perspiration beclouding evening football, and by nightfall women are like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum. People will move slowly too. They will take their time about everything. After all, a day is twenty-four hours long though now it will seem longer. There is no hurry. Save sweat and strength. The heat and brightness of the dry season bring some optimism, light, and inspiration into our lives, calling for a period of self-reflection so we take our time, we put away, we plan, we execute... we AESTIVATE. The freshness of the rainy season, the hope and reassurance it brings, the dark clouds and cold winds, the gentle drops of rain and the boisterous torrents; it births life. Animals want to spend time together, humans want to cuddle, and everyone wants to gather round to feel warm. COMMUNITY. So while you air dry your clothes outside and they don’t get to dry on time, every other thing is moving fine and flourishing around you, you get fresh water from the skies, and the land is becoming green again… Life Seasons aren’t that different from Nature’s Seasons. When we are about to shift into the dry season, for example, we find it hard to cope with the heat from the sun, the dryness of the ground, and drying up of bushes, but we get to adapt because we can’t resist it. The same thing with the rainy season, that inertia to get used to rainy mornings, jumping over waterlogged sections of roads, etc., is ever present. The seasons are not the issue, we are. It’s easy to get stuck in a season of your life because of how good it has been, so you resist moving to the next phase, and it’s normal because nobody wants to do the work or live a life that entails uncertainty, simple human logic. However, if you want to pursue growth and progress, you must be at home with not being able to figure it out entirely, you must be able to cope with the changes that come with lifestyle and discipline that comes with each season of life. Be okay with the uncertainty that comes with taking certain risks and decisions. Sometimes when you resist seasons, you are only hindering your progress. Seasons are part of life, what matters is your preparation towards them. Don’t allow complacency and the fear of uncertainty to hinder you, there’s more out there. 🥂🥂",

        title: "The Real Story Behind Christmas",
        description: "Colourful lighting. Knockouts and firecrackers. Food sharing and other aesthetics have been attached to Christmas but what’s the actual backstory like? About 3000 years ago… Some 3000 years ago... man like Isaiah - the biggest prophet of ancient Israel, prophesied that: 'For a child is born to us, a son is given to us. The government will rest on his shoulders. And he will be called: Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. His government and its peace will never end. He will rule with fairness and justice from the throne of his ancestor David for all eternity. The passionate commitment of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies will make this happen!' (Isaiah 9:6-7 NLT) This was during a time Judah and Israel suffered at the hands of bad leaders who were unjust and cruel, desecrating the position of kingship and priesthood, leading Israel to sin… Fast forward to about 700 years later; Israel is in captivity under the Roman empire and a lady is in town claiming she’s pregnant yet she hasn’t slept with any man, not even her fiancé Joseph, this lady’s name is Mary. 'This is how Jesus the Messiah was born. His mother, Mary, was engaged to be married to Joseph. But before the marriage took place, while she was still a virgin, she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit. Joseph, to whom she was engaged, was a righteous man and did not want to disgrace her publicly, so he decided to break the engagement quietly. As he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. “Joseph, son of David,” the angel said, “do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For the child within her was conceived by the Holy Spirit. And she will have a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” All of this occurred to fulfill the Lord’s message through his prophet: 'Look! The virgin will conceive a child! She will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel, which means ‘God is with us.’' (Matthew 1:18-25 NLT) Mary claimed she got pregnant of the Holy Ghost and the child she was going to give birth to is a holy one - something like the Saviour of the world. After 9 months, Mary is due to deliver, she is out with Joseph her fiancé to be taxed in Bethlehem their home country and there came the labour pains... 'Joseph help me out! my water just broke!' With no home to stay, no room to dwell, the child was given birth to in a manger where horses and donkeys fed, with angels announcing His earthly visitation. 'That night there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby, guarding their flocks of sheep. Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared among them, and the radiance of the Lord’s glory surrounded them. They were terrified, but the angel reassured them. “Don’t be afraid!” he said. “I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people. The Savior—yes, the Messiah, the Lord—has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David! And you will recognize him by this sign: You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger.” Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others—the armies of heaven—praising God and saying, 'Glory to God in highest heaven, and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased.' When the angels had returned to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, 'Let’s go to Bethlehem! Let’s see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.'” (Luke 2:8-15 NLT) Day in the life of the Saviour… Later on, He lived with so much purpose and high expectations from his parents, his people in captivity, the sick and bound, you know just like what you would expect from a saviour in contemporary times - 'deliver us from military rule' 'break us off colonialism' or 'give our people economic prosperity.' But this saviour came fixing the fundamental issue; saving our souls and reconnecting our lineage to that of God, reconciling us back to the father and therefore making us claim all our inheritance as heirs in God - salvation, deliverance, prosperity, power, authority and ultimately a place with Him in heaven. He did it, completing his ministry at a seemingly untimely age of 33. Through His birth, death and resurrection, we are what we are today - Kings and Priests… So yes, get the colourful lightings, the firecrackers and food too for this is one way to celebrate the beautiful gift of Christmas - JESUS CHRIST.",

        title: "A Gen Z Nostalgia: 'Back and Forth, but Reality Is Still What It Is...'",
        description: "The 90's were better. They just were. I'm not sorry, it is. It is the past, but we weren't ancient, there was higher food security, civilization was present without all of the pathologies of the internet. Nigeria probably sucked then, but my 50kobo could go places my present 200Naira wouldn't, and there wasn't this constant sense of things falling apart like Chinua Achebe's Play. Though I was born in 1999, yet I was able to live through some of the best times in Nigeria's history and of course live through the past my parents saw. Gas was cheap and we didn't yet know that we should feel guilty for burning it, but yeah at least we had functioning refineries that could meet our nation's needs. Newspapers were common then and I would find one in my neighborhood or I'd be lucky if my dad brought one home; that's where I would see new brands of cars(that me and my friends competed for), job vacancies, things I would aspire for and of course the state of the Nation. Back then, you used to do things and have places to do them. Call centers? You guessed right, but then there were also record stores, movie and song rental shops where you could walk in and select movies of your choice, watch and return back at cheap prices, that’s how we got to watch our favorite Aki and PawPaw movies. But a record store was a place. And places demonstrate devotion. You’d go in there and they’d play cool stuff that you hadn’t heard before, which was one way to discover new stuff. So was flipping endlessly through every CD in a row. You’d care so much about a particular artiste that you would buy their albums and then you went home and precisely because you didn’t have access to all the music that ever existed, you listened to the whole album, again and again, devotedly, knowing the whole lyrics of a full album just because you listened to it and not repetitively scrolling through other shit on your phone simultaneously _ those were the days it was easy to not be a multitasker. Our women were our men’s pride; I remember days when I would sit with my mum in her hair salon and get to see and watch women have discussions that seemed to surround family, the home and just experience feminine beauty in its purest form, I bet the discussions these days are different. Nigerians are nostalgic people; nostalgia informs and can explain much of who we are and what we do. After all, to be Nigerian is to remember when Nigeria was Nigeria. If not as memory, as ideology. In 2015, we produced a president by voting not on policies, plans or promises but on nostalgia, learning in the process the downsides to such practice. Still, in 2019, most of us renewed our foolishness. But there's of course nothing new in looking longingly back, whether to times we've lived through, or those we haven't. If there's anytime nostalgia would be necessary for a Gen Z, it should be in marketing; research indicates that just adding a nostalgia-inducing slogan to packaging can favorably enhance product appeal. 'Retro items make us nostalgic and nostalgic feelings make us happy' says Phil Cordaro, an economic and social psychologist at the University of Cologne. Sometimes 'as good as it's always been is often a more powerful message than new and improved'. The current prevalence of retro is largely due to the dissatisfaction with the present. Especially in recent times, with global economic problems, with the internet changing how we live and communicate, there is a sense of comfort in nostalgia. Now much of the world has been in one way or another carrying out exercises in Nostalgia, for a 'healthier' world. We have politicians employing the use of nostalgia to win elections, artists portraying it in their arts, a world where identity crisis was not a thing, a world on the right side of history, certainly, a pre-COVID 19 world, indeed a world so promising that even Africa, its 'poverty-ridden continent' was said to be 'rising'. This was a world of such copious opportunities that even Nigeria saw itself emerging from the decade as one of the top twenty economies in the world _ The Giant of Africa. It is true that, in Nigeria at least, Gen Zs are among the first in a long line of descendants that didn't experience a working Nigeria, it is also a sad fact that the most stable many African youths have ever experienced their country is under the dictatorship of successive military governments. A Bridge _that’s what Gen Zs are; the bridge between analog pasts and digital futures such is how I would describe this generation. A people who by incidence of time, possess the ability to embody multiple lives in several verses of their universe; offline/online, being able to live in parallel universes (metaverses). We've been back and forth in the past and reality through nostalgia but it is what it is. Whatever it is that excites you about the past, the experiences or feelings that you missed, the faces you met, or the comfort in them. Longing for things that have long been passed wouldn't change a thing. If you would look back from your future and have nostalgia, it depends on what you make of today, and it doesn't have to be good, just make it memorable and enjoy every bit of it as nostalgia is a vital component in the formation and maintenance of personal identity. The purpose of life is to live it🥂.",

        description: "It’s not been a long day without you my tasteless buddy, each day I taste of you now, it’s a renewed hatred my longtime companion. Can’t really pinpoint a time in space where my journey with this tasteless buddy began. But I remember the combo that brought us close; fried fish and this buddy. My father introduced me to this combo one evening. He was reading through his books in our up north home in Kano, everything seemed to blend that evening so I still remember when this tasteless buddy landed on my taste buds, not heavenly nor romantic but the taste caught me off guard. That combo bought my soul and ever since I’ve been a captive... fast forward to a time in 2019 that this buddy became my only means of surviving in this side of the universe, it held the hands of me and my two friends as we navigated ‘sapa’ in our second year in the hostels of University of Abuja. Garri was there for us even when many of our friends and other classes of food became high class. It was like that faithful girlfriend that feeds you and your friends and then you call her 'our wife’. We survived that year but now it’s a horror story for me, it was traumatic existence, it’s an experience I wouldn’t want to relive as everytime I tried this buccal intercourse with this meal everything seems not to ‘gel’ again, my heart has been embittered by the many years of secret affair with garri and the traumatic experiences surrounding my consumption of it; I would innocently smile with a cup and spoon in my hand and my neighbors would be deciphering, whispering to each other if I had just had another affair with you or was in the process of one. Maybe you were not just a buddy… maybe we were friends with benefit… I carried your scent or so I thought but then I discovered it was a ‘you’ problem and not a ‘me’ problem. The only version of you presented to me was a low class edition… I’m sorry dear buddy, you’ve lost your touch; I’ve not only gotten familiar, I’ve given up on this friendship you can’t gbemi dè bé any longer. I guess I’d subscribe you to a higher class through association with groundnut and classy milk possibly nature’s best coconut and not just rely on Sugar to do the work. But for now let’s have a hi-hi relationship, nothing deep, you see me I greet you, I see you, you say nothing till I approach. Thanks for your understanding! PS: Garri is granulated cassava in Nigerian parlance.",

        title: "Most Unlikely Collaboration in Nigerian Music?: Reviewing Skepta × Portable — Tony Montana.",
        description: "Genre: Afrobeats Language: English, Yoruba, Nigerian Pidgin Artistes: Skepta (Joseph Adenuga) and Portable (Habeeb Okikiola). Big Smoke pẹ’lú tobacco Tony-Tony, Tony Montana Wacko, psycho I want to explode Fire oh, ginger oh (ginger oh) Somebody pour me water, oh I dey on my own Waka jeje, make you no jam àgbákò These were the words that followed a melodious harmony of strings and at first they didn’t make sense to me. I mean what would an average person expect from Portablebaeby’s music? The hot headed street pop musician with so much perseverance and self belief. But this time being featured by Big Smoke (Skepta) it must mean something… Beat The beat itself is giving heavy, wavy Afrobeats energy; a type portable baby should be able to flow on, maybe something of an experiment for Skepta (being a Grime artiste). Surprisingly, both artistes delivered, utilizing every moment of this beat and at the end giving us space to marvel at their creativity and delivery. Storytelling Skepta tries to tell a story with his verses; a big blown, high class maybe diasporan Nigerian that comes from the bottom of society to the top (embodying the character of Tony Montana) at the same time trying to be there for his people, talking about “...Never catch me stuntin' on my own people That’s my brother from another mother Uh, I cut the slice precise, so it’s equal…” He also talks about the throes and dangers that comes with being a top G; “How they hate me 'cause I’m winnin'? AP kickin’, my Rolliе ain’t tickin' One of 150, the whip that I’m whippin' Now, they wishing they could’ve catched a man slippin’ Skepta paints a picture of the fictional character “Tony Montana” in Scarface, but this time high class lover with some bit of danger. “Take a shot to the head, that’s a Kennedy…” “I came with the criminals, my Co-D defendin' me…” Generally, the whole idea of this collaboration is embodied in his verses — a juxtaposition of cultures and characters. Song Video The song video oozed class with both artistes dressed in flashy outfits and styled by Steelo (Skepta’s stylist). Portable could be seen literally embodying his verse, dancing liberally like he would explode and ending with his signature Zazu puff dance.",

        description: "E “bee” things. Barry “Bee' Benson is a bee that just graduated bee college and was out into the bee workforce (pollen collection and honey making), he thought he wasn’t fit for it. Instead, he chose to go out into the human world and explore. He met a florist (Vanessa) by chance, and they got close. On a visit to the grocery store with Vanessa, Barry saw their (bees) only product — honey being sold over the counter (he later got to see where they were manufactured “illegally”) to the detriment of bees, also infringing on their proprietary rights. He decided to sue the human race (with the help of Vanessa), and won. The world’s collection of honey were recalled, bee population got unemployed, the world population of flowers started wilting. No flowers. No pollination, their win completely upended the course of nature; it was a perversion of the balance of nature. Haven noticed their wrong plus with the organizational quality and skills of bees, they restored balance to the world, by getting foreign pollen and flowering up the world again. There were some interesting word plays in this movie, and some quite raunchy talks too. Some excerpts from the movie below: 1. “...when I’m done with the humans, they wouldn’t be able to say 'honey I’m home!” without paying royalties…” __ Barry Benson. 2. “…why is your life anymore valuable than mine?” __Andy Flayman (Barry’s Bee friend in response to a human) 3. “what is it like to sting someone?” Asked Barry Bee. “It was all adrenaline at first and then ecstasy.” __ Andy Flayman The movie has a 50% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The comedy, puns and lessons therein are actually worth the watch (especially if you are out of college and you want to change the world🙂). Add to your list, worth watching.",

It’s the conscious effort to show up, to be present, and to actively engage with the people we care about.

Life gets busy, and it’s all too easy to let our relationships fall by the wayside. That’s why it’s important to make a deliberate effort to prioritize the people we love. Whether it’s setting aside dedicated time to spend together, making an effort to communicate openly and honestly, or simply showing small acts of kindness and appreciation, every action we take can help strengthen our connections with others. Intentionality is also about being present in the moment. It’s about putting down our phones, turning off the distractions, and truly listening to the people we’re with.

        description: "“I’m sorry,” I mumbled under my breath, my gaze never leaving the plate before me. The clinking of cutlery was the only sound I could hear in the quiet restaurant. I had been distant lately, caught up in my own thoughts and worries. But tonight was different; I was determined to make things right. As I looked up, I caught her eyes, and for a moment, it felt like the weight of the world had been lifted off my shoulders. “I love you,” she said softly, reaching across the table to take my hand. And in that moment, I knew that no matter what happened, we would be okay. Intentionality is the fuel that drives all meaningful relationships. It’s the conscious effort to show up, to be present, and to actively engage with the people we care about. Whether it’s a romantic partnership, a friendship, or a familial bond, intentionality is what keeps the flame alive. But it’s not always easy. Life gets busy, and it’s all too easy to let our relationships fall by the wayside. That’s why it’s important to make a deliberate effort to prioritize the people we love. Whether it’s setting aside dedicated time to spend together, making an effort to communicate openly and honestly, or simply showing small acts of kindness and appreciation, every action we take can help strengthen our connections with others. Intentionality is also about being present in the moment. It’s about putting down our phones, turning off the distractions, and truly listening to the people we’re with. It’s about being fully engaged and emotionally available, even when it’s not convenient. And it’s about being willing to put in the work, even when things get tough. Because ultimately, the relationships we cultivate are a reflection of the effort we put into them. So let’s make a commitment to be intentional in our relationships. Let’s show up for each other, day in and day out, with love, kindness, and understanding. Let’s make every moment count, and cherish the connections we have, for they are truly what make life worth living. 🌹",
